This doc lists some of the most common and most useful properties and methods available on strings.

All strings have at their disposal several built-in properties, but there's a single property that is really useful: the length property:

~~~
var greet = "Hello, ";
greet.length; // 7
~~~

To read each individual character at a specific index in a string, starting from zero, you can use the charAt() method:

~~~
"Wo".concat("rl").concat("d"); // 'World'
~~~

The indexOf returns the location of the first position that matches a character:
~~~
"ho-ho-ho".indexOf('h'); // 0
"ho-ho-ho".indexOf('o'); // 1
"ho-ho-ho".indexOf('-'); // 2
~~~

The lastIndexOf finds the last match, otherwise it works the same as indexOf.

The split method chops up the string into an array of substrings:
~~~
"ho-ho-ho".split("-"); // ['ho', 'ho', 'ho']
~~~

There are also some methods to change the casing of strings. For example:
~~~
greet.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO, "
greet.toLowerCase(); // "hello, "
~~~
